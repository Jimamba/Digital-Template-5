<h2>Stop the Bomb</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A very simple game where the player must choose which button will turn off the bomb.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to experience a sense of reliance on luck, since this game is completely
dependent on it.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Luck-based mini-game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player has four options to choose from;q,w,e,r. Only one of those options ends with
the player winning. All the others end with the bomb exploding. The player has 30 seconds to make their choice.
If they don't make a choice, they will automatically lose when time runs out. What I wasn't able to add was that each time the
game was loaded I wanted to have which button would stop the bomb change. However, I'm not really sure how I would've done that.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Luck-based gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It's a game entirely dependent on the player's luck, not skill.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Since the theme is unwilling participent, you the player, are the unwilling participent in defusing this bomb.
Only one wire stops the bomb and you must figure it out within 30 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There's not really a story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual Gamers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
At most 30 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There really is no strategy that you can use, it's all up to your luck.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My 3rd prototype game.
